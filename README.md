# 30 Days of TSA( Time Series Analysis )

A personal challenge to work learn and practice Time Series Analysis (TSA) skills over 30 days through weekly projects.

## Overview

This project focuses on building and enhancing Time Series Analysis skills through a series of weekly projects. Each day will involve working on a different aspect of TSA, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of TSA techniques and best practices while creating a portfolio of work.

## weekly projects

- [Day 1: Time Series Fundamentals](./day1/)
- [Day 2: Time Series Data from APIs](./day2/)
- [Day 3: Visualizing Time Series Data](./day3/)

## Project Details

### Day 1: Time Series Fundamentals

**Status**: ✓ Complete

**Objective**: Analyze Daily Delhi Climate data to understand seasonal trends and time series patterns

**Key Deliverables**:
- Time series visualization of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure
- Identification of seasonal trends and patterns
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Interactive Plotly visualizations

**Outcomes**:
- Successfully identified clear seasonal patterns in temperature and humidity
- Demonstrated effective use of pandas for data manipulation
- Created reusable visualization pipeline
- Documented insights for practical applications

### Day 2: Time Series Data from APIs

**Status**: ✓ Complete

**Objective**: Fetch and analyze financial time series data from Yahoo Finance API

**Key Deliverables**:
- Integration with yfinance API for real-time financial data
- Gold (GLD) price data extraction and cleaning
- 10-year historical price analysis
- Interactive financial visualization with proper scaling
- Comprehensive data cleaning pipeline

**Outcomes**:
- Successfully fetched and processed 10 years of gold price data
- Implemented robust data cleaning for API-sourced datasets
- Created publication-quality visualizations for financial time series
- Demonstrated practical API integration in time series analysis

### Day 3: Visualizing Time Series Data

**Status**: ✓ Complete

**Objective**: Master advanced visualization techniques for time series data

**Key Deliverables**:
- Multiple time series visualization approaches (line plots, moving averages)
- Rolling statistics analysis (30-day and 90-day moving averages)
- Seasonal decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- Interactive multi-panel visualizations
- Volatility measurement and visualization

**Outcomes**:
- Successfully created comprehensive visualization toolkit
- Demonstrated seasonal decomposition for pattern recognition
- Implemented moving averages for trend identification
- Created publication-quality interactive charts with Plotly

### Day 4: Stationarity Concepts

**Status**: ✓ Complete

**Objective**: Understand and test for stationarity in time series data

**Key Deliverables**:
- Educational explanation of weak stationarity (constant mean, variance, autocorrelation)
- Visual comparison of stationary vs non-stationary synthetic data
- Rolling statistics visualization for stationarity detection
- Autocorrelation Function (ACF) analysis and interpretation
- Foundation for data preprocessing before ARIMA modeling

**Outcomes**:
- Successfully demonstrated stationarity concepts with synthetic and real data
- Identified gold prices as non-stationary with visual and statistical evidence
- Provided practical tools for stationarity assessment
- Established preprocessing requirements for forecasting models

## Goals

- Understand the basics of Time Series data
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create meaningful visualizations
- Extract actionable insights from time series data
- Build a portfolio of TSA projects

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, plotly, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn (ML pipelines and ensemble methods)
- Statsmodels (Time Series Analysis)
- Time Series specific libraries (fbprophet, pmdarima)
