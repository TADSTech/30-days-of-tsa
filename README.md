# 30 Days of TSA( Time Series Analysis )

A personal challenge to work learn and practice Time Series Analysis (TSA) skills over 30 days through weekly projects.

## Overview

This project focuses on building and enhancing Time Series Analysis skills through a series of weekly projects. Each day will involve working on a different aspect of TSA, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of TSA techniques and best practices while creating a portfolio of work.
