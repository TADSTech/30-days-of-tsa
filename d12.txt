Day 12: Autoregressive (AR) Models

✓ Completed
- AR process fundamentals and theory
- PACF-based order selection
- AR(10) model fitting and comparison with AR(1) and AR(2)
- Coefficient extraction and interpretation
- Forecast performance evaluation (10.69% improvement over naive)
- Stationarity testing with ADF
- Residual diagnostics
- Comprehensive documentation in README

Key Findings:
- Optimal AR order: 10 (by AIC and BIC)
- RMSE: 35.60 vs Naive: 39.87
- Improvement: 10.69% over naive forecast
- Small coefficients reflect weak autocorrelation in financial returns
- First difference makes series stationary
